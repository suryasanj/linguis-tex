# linguis-tex
All the scripts one might need for using TeX for linguistics.

## Description
$\LaTeX$ is great for typesetting, but, in spite of CTAN and community-created packages, there are still some niches left to fill. This repository handles those within linguistics. 

## Non-Roman Scripts
1. **Royal Achæmenid Elamite Cuneiform -- Text Mapping**
   Signs are derived from Paper’s (1955) list. Some signs are missing; namely 《kúp》,《kar》, 《šir₇》, 《zik》, and two logograms for man and king. You can use the normal transcription scheme for RAE (with 〈z〉 instead of 〈ṣ〉), with one minor change: the vertical and horizontal determinatives, as well as the logogram sign, should be written in Unicode superscript.
