# linguis-tex
All the scripts one might need for using \TeX for linguistics.

## Description
$\LaTeX$ is great for typesetting, but, in spite of CTAN and community-created 
packages, there are still some niches left to fill. This repository handles those within linguistics. 

## Mapping for Non-Roman Scripts

Typing in other scripts is difficult, especially when most of us are confined to
a QWERTY keyboard. Mapping allows one to type in a commonly used transcription
scheme, outputting Unicode characters in the target script.

   Signs are derived from Paper’s (1955) list. Some signs are missing: namely, «kúp», 
   «kar», «šir₇», «zik», and two logograms for man and king. Use the normal 
   transcription scheme for RAE (with ‹z› instead of ‹ṣ›), with one minor change: 
   the vertical and horizontal determinatives, as well as the logogram sign, 
   should be written in Unicode superscript.
